This is my first project which is (IoT-based Smart Energy Management).
I am uploading the sensors data to Azure IoT central application.
I am creating a dshboard through one can check the temperature, voltage and current readings of a sensors and one can also find the power consumption of any appliance which has these sensors connected.I'm also integrating jenkins with github.
